				<p>
				I am a current Junior studying for my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Manhattan College, in the Bronx. 
				Throughout my academic career, I have maintained exceptional academic standing with the school. 
				</p>

				<p>
				Throughout the past few years, I have been fortunate enough to work many different jobs in various fields, and each 
				of them has taught me new things, and helped shaped me into who I am today. 
				I am currently employed by the Manhattan College ITS Department, and through this position, I have greatly expanded my 
				knowledge of computer systems. 
				I am excited to bring these skills and experiences to any team I join. 
				</p>

				<p>
				I pride myself on being reliable, quick-thinking, and hard-working. 
				I enjoy working in fast-paced, in person environments, where I can work on challenging problems with my peers. 
				Thank you for taking the time to read my resume and learn more about me.
