				Throughout the past few years, I have been fortunate enough to work many different jobs in various fields, and each 
				of them has taught me new things, and helped shaped me into who I am today. I am currently employed by the Manhattan College
				ITS Department, and through this position, I have greatly expanded my knowledge of computer systems. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				My experiences inside and outside of the classroom have given me the skills necessary to be a great fit for any team. 
				Paragraph about how my skills and knowledge make me a great candidate

				</p>
				
				<p>
				I enjoy working in a fast-paced, in-person environment, where I have the opportunity to learn new skills and increase my 
				experience in the computer science field. My goal is to apply the skills that I currently possess to any team that I join.
